# Web-Scraper-Project
Class Project with Python in Which I Scraped All of Shakespeare's Works From A Website, Tokenizes All Text, Creates a Bi-gram Index, and then Allows for the User to Search for a particular word throughout all of his works, with the play, act, and scene in which that word occurred is presented to the user. If nothing is found that matches, then alternate spellings are provided.
